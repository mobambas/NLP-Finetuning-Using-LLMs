MetaFineTune streamlines large language model adaptation with a novel meta-learning framework, enabling swift task-specific fine-tuning with minimal data. By dynamically adjusting strategies, it accelerates text generation while reducing computational demands, since not all parameters are required to be trained during the fine-tuning process.
